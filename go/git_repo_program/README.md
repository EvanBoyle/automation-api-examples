# Git Repo Program

This program demonstrates how to use Automation API with a Pulumi program from git remote. This example deploys the [aws-go-s3 project from the pulumi examples repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-go-s3-folder). The Automation API takes care of all of the work of cloning and setting up the repo.

To run this example you'll need a few pre-reqs:
1. A Pulumi CLI installation ([v3.0.0](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) or later)
2. The AWS CLI, with appropriate credentials.

Running this program is just like any other Go program. No invocation through the Pulumi CLI required:

```shell
$ go run main.go
Created/Selected stack "dev", and cloned program from git
Successfully set config
Starting refresh
Refresh succeeded!
Starting update
Updating (dev)

To destroy the stack when you're done, invoke the program with an additional `destroy` argument:

```shell
$ go run main.go destroy
Created/Selected stack "dev", and cloned program from git
Successfully set config
Starting refresh
Refresh succeeded!
Starting stack destroy
Destroying (dev)

The resources in the stack have been deleted, but the history and configuration associated with the stack are still maintained.
If you want to remove the stack completely, run 'pulumi stack rm dev'.
