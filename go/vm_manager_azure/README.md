# Azure VM Manager (VMGR)

In this example we use Automation API to build a high-level operational CLI that is an abstraction over Pulumi. The goal is to build a platform that allows uses to provision temporary VMs. Users typically forget about these VMs, so we want an automated way to clean them up after a specified period of time. To accomplish this we build a custom CLI called `vmgr`.

`vmgr` is a tool designed to provision Azure VMs with a temporary lifetime. The tool consists of two commands:

- `vmgr add`: creates a new VM webserver with a public IP. these web servers share a resource group and virtual network that is referenced from a shared stack.
- `vmgr cron <expiration>`: scans all VM stacks on a minutely cadence, looking for stacks that are older than the specified expiration duration. Given that public IP dissociation can be a little flakey, this command will continue to retry deletion even if it sees failures. Typically it will succeed in deleting the VM and public IP on the second try. Example: `vmgr cron 5m` to delete vms older than 5 minutes, or `vmgr cron 5d` to delete VMs older than five days.

## Installation

```shell
# install the binary
$ go install github.com/pulumi/automation-api-examples/go/vm_manager_azure/cmd/vmgr
```

Note that this requires Pulumi CLI >= v3.0.0 and an authenticated Azure CLI.

## Adding VMs
```shell
$ vmgr add
setting up webserver stack...
ensuring network is configured...
found existing network stack
deploying vm webserver...
deployed server running at public IP 40.78.90.53
# imagine that a few VMs are added in the background ...
```

## Running the Cron VM Reaper

```shell
# run vmgr cron to look for VMs older than five minutes
$ vmgr cron 5m

### Retrying failures

Sometimes `vmgr` encounters errors trying to destroy the stacks; Azure IPs can require retries when deleting. `vmgr` will retry those failures on the next pass after sleeping for 60 seconds.

On the first try it fails to delete stack `vmgr65433804`:
```shell
$ vmgr cron 5m
Checking for VMs over 5m old to reap...
